# First Ansible Playbook

This repository contains my first Ansible playbook, `first_playbook.yml`. This playbook is very basic and serves as my first step into learning and using Ansible.

## Playbook Description

The `first_playbook.yml` playbook performs the following tasks on all hosts:

1. Installs Nginx: This task uses the `apt` module to ensure that Nginx is installed.

2. Starts Nginx: This task uses the `service` module to ensure that the Nginx service is started.

## Usage

To run this playbook, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml
